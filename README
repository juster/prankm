NAME
    prankm -- Parallel ping ranker for pacman's mirrorlist.

SYNOPSIS
      prankm [-i] [-n #] [-m #.#] [/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist]

      Ranks the mirrorlist file. If a mirrorlist is not given as an
      argument then the default /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist file is read.

      Options:
       -n | --num      The number of top ranked servers to use in file.
                       Set to 0 to use all servers. Default: 20
       -m | --max      Maximum delay to wait for pings, in seconds.
                       Default: 0.25
       -i | --inplace  Inplace editing, overwrite source file with results.
       -h | --help     This help screen.

OPTIONS
    -n|--num
        The maximum number of servers pacman should use. The top ranked
        servers are left uncommented in the output, with the rest commented
        out.

    -m|--max
        The maximum amount of time to wait for ping responses. After this
        delay the program will stop waiting for pings and print the
        serverlist.

    -i|--inplace
        Overwrite the mirrorlist file specified or
        */etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist* if none was specified.
